### (20%) 1. Please compare hash function and cryptographic hash function and give an example.

The ideal cryptographic hash function has six main properties:
- **Deterministic**: Intput and output are one to one, with very high probability.
- **Quick**: Compute within resonable time. 
- **One-way function**: Easy on hash, hard on reverse.
- **Avalanche effect**: No obvious relation between two hashs from similar inputs.
- **Collision resistant**: it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value
- **Pre-image attack resistant**: Hard to find an input that produce specific hash.

The difference between cryptographic hash function and non-cryptographic hash function is that cryptographic hash function garentee above-mentioned six properties, which non-cryptographic hash function does not.But non-cryptographic hash can compute a lot faster, sacrifice a little bit of security.

> BLAKE(2) is a cryptographic hash function, SeaHash is not. Even the fastest implementations of BLAKE only gets around 7.8 cycles/byte (hardware might do it twice as fast). SeaHash gets 0.24 cycles/byte. That's a wide difference, around 32x faster.

As long as someone don't brute force a non-cryptographic hash function, it can still be useful in check sum, 
hash tables, etc.
